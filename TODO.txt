    to pick up (take).

    inventory to retrieve or activate

    inventory to drop in the current room.

Flesh out DROP command to add dropped item to room's item list

    specifying the exit of the current room to open door of.

Implement INVENTORY command, which should display the PC's inventory as a numbered listing

Flesh out INVENTORY command to display an asterisk preceding an item currently active and/or equipped
